        Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can
        improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.[1] It
        is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning
        algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data,
        in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly
        programmed to do so.[2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide
        variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech
        recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to
        develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.[3]A subset
        of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics,
        which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine
        learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization
        delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine
        learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on
        exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.[5][6] Some
        implementations of machine learning use data and neural networks in a
        way that mimics the working of a biological brain.[7][8] In its
        application across business problems, machine learning is also referred
        to as predictive analytics.
